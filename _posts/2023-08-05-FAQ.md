# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### 1. Why is there no progress when using SPFlash Tool?
- If you click download, but there is no progress, go to `Options > Option > Connection` and try another COM port. If still no progress, go back to `Options > Option > General` and untick `Storage Life Cycle Check`.

- Use local method 
**AND / OR**

- Try to access fastboot by turning the phone off and holding **Power and Volume Down** 

### 4. I got a `Signature Verification error` in recovery mode. What do I do?
