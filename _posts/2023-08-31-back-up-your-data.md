# This method makes a backup of entire partitions, so you can restore your base system in case you want to go back to stock. 
# ❗ PERSONAL DATA IS NOT BACKED UP USING THIS METHOD <BR>Use GDrive, another cloud service, or transfer your personal data to a physical media, wherever you feel it is safe.

## Prerequisites
- [USB2SER](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_SWiU9Ip9-sf8D-7VVIxcfXUpjsKlAdz/view?usp=drive_link)
- [USBDk](https://github.com/daynix/UsbDk/releases/download/v1.00-22/UsbDk_1.0.22_x64.msi)
- [Python from Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5)
- [MTK Client archive](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## 1. Install python, USB2SER (find the `cdc-acm.inf` file, right click and press `Install`) and USBdk

## 2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in a cmd in `MTK Client's folder to install all required dependencies. Prepare a folder in which to store backed up partitions.

## 3. Turn your phone off, hold volume buttons, run this command `python mtk rl --skip userdata "<full path to store the backup files>" ` and connect your phone to your computer (Replace `<full path to store the backup files>` with the path of the folder you made in Step 2). If you want to back up specific partitions, use this command `python mtk r partition-name partition-name.img` (replace `partition-name` with the partition you want to back up. For example, for `boot` it would be `python mtk r boot boot.img`)

## 4. After the command finishes, check the folder to make sure the backup was made to the correct location and that there are *51 files*

## To flash the entire backup back to your device use `python mtk wl (folder name)` in a command prompt. To only flash some files use `python mtk w (partition) (file name)`.

# ❗ A preloader file will be backed up inside `mtk client` folder. Keep that file as safe as possible, as it's crucial to restoring the firmware.

# ❗ DO NOT FLASH SOMEONE ELSE'S FIRMWARE FILES (EXCEPT ONES SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED FOR THAT PURPOSE AND FOR THESE EXCLUDE `cdt_engineering` AND `opporeserve2`)
