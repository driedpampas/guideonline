> ðŸ›‘ This is for rooted devices only

## Magisk
- Install [safetynet-fix](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JBEgzBqVKWD1U5GgP46sFXse_1UmqgCJ/view?usp=sharing) with Magisk Manager
- use denylist

## KernelSU (only if ROM does **NOT pass by DEFAULT**, KernelSU root should not break SafetyNet)
- Install [safetynet-fix](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JBEgzBqVKWD1U5GgP46sFXse_1UmqgCJ/view?usp=sharing) with the KernelSU app
